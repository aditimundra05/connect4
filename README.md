# GuacamoRLe Project for Codeology Spring 2024
With GuacamoRLe, we will be introducing the basic concepts of reinforcement learning and how we can utilize it to build a bot that can play Connect4 like a pro! You will be training your own bot to become the best Connect4 strategist by learning how to fine tune the weights associated in its neural networks, the different applications of RL algorithms, and game agents and environments. At the end, you will submit your bot to the Kaggle ConnectX multiplayer competition and evaluate how well your algorithm performs in comparison to others!


This notebook contains our minimax and RL agent for Connect4. It also contains homework skeleton code for a one-step lookahead agent, minimax agent, and RL agent.
